Premise:
Play as a law enforcer in the City of Iron, as you control a cyborg stationed at the top of the city's iconic Iron Watchtower
who must utilize the weapon you've been provided, a railgun, to maintain the peace and order of the city.

Setting:
The City of Iron stands as the vanguard for mankind as one of the few remaining civilizations in the world.
It's walls stand tall and proud amidst the ruined lands and so do its citizens.
However, appearances can be deceiving as the city of iron is equally ruled with an iron fist.
Under the dictatorship of Supreme Emperor Yulm, both the city and its citizens are run on tight rules.
Any form of opposition against his rule or any sort lawlessness in the city is swiftly met with judgement, dealt out by the city's Wired Guards.
Wired Guards - Soldiers trained to man cyborgs located at the top of the Iron Watchtower, granting them full view over the city, 
allowing them to dish out justice according to the Emperor's will.
